                        <p> <span class="aw_1">Although we talk about a few historical early forms of virtual reality elsewhere on the site, today virtual reality is usually implemented using computer technology.</span>
                        There are a range of systems that are used for this purpose to stimulate our senses together in order to create the illusion of reality such as <b>Headsets</b>, <b>Omni-directional treadmills</b> and <b>Special Gloves</b>.</p>

                        <p><span class="aw_2">This is more difficult than it sounds, since our senses and brains are evolved to provide us with a finely synchronized and mediated experience.</span> If anything is even a little off we can usually tell. This is where you’ll hear terms such asimmersiveness  and realism enter the conversation. These issues that divide convincing or enjoyable virtual reality experiences from jarring or unpleasant ones are partly technical and partly conceptual. Virtual reality technology needs to take our physiology into account. 
                        <span class="aw_3"><b>For example:</b> <br>The human visual field does not look like a video frame. We have (more or less) 180 degrees of vision and although you are not always consciously aware of your peripheral vision, if it were gone you’d notice. Similarly when what your eyes and the vestibular system in your ears tell you are in conflict it can cause motion sickness. Which is what happens to some people on boats or when they read while in a car.</span>
                        If an implementation of virtual reality manages to get the combination of hardware, software and sensory synchronicity just right it achieves something known as a sense of presence. Where the subject really feels like they are present in that environment.</p>

                        <div class="border_bottom"><h2>VR Glasses</h2></div>
                        <p>Virtual reality GLASSES are becoming increasingly popular in the gaming and entertainment spheres. They are lighter and more comfortable to wear than the standard head mounted display (HMD) and many of them incorporate a range of interactive devices.
                        <br><br>Examples of these include audio, video and head tracking. More advanced versions of these glasses contain head tracking systems. <br>This system is connected to a computer which sends signals to adjust the images seen by the wearer as they move around their environment.
                        </p>
                        <div class="stereo">
                            <h3>Stereoscopy</h3>
                            <p>These glasses behave in a similar way to a pair of 3D goggles in that they display two images. Ordinary glasses show a single image but 3D and virtual reality glasses contain polarised lenses which show two images, one per each eye. These images appear to give an illusion of depth which is a particular feature of CAVE environments. This is popularly known as Stereoscopy.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>These glasses enable the wearer to see three dimensional images which give an illusion of depth of perception. For example, if the wearer is using virtual reality for architectural purposes then they will be able to view a building at different angles, and walk through or around it.

                        Many types of glasses contain a tracking system which maps the wearer’s movements and adjusts the images accordingly. Each time the wearer moves his head, walks in a particular direction or takes some other form of action, the scene in front of him changes as he does so.<br><br>

                        The tracking system is connected to a computer which adjusts these images so that the wearer is shown a realistic environment with a realistic depth of perception. The tracking needs to be as accurate as it can be or else the illusion breaks down.<br><br>

                        The glasses enable the wearer to see two separate images which the brain combines into one. This is what gives the illusion of 3D depth. This is often accompanied by video and/or sound which add to the experience.

                        The aim is to present the wearer with a world which is realistic and behaves in a similar way to the real world. Any delay or latency will cause a disconnection between the two and in some cases, feelings of motion sickness. This then disrupts their experience.</p>

                                <p>Google Cardboard is a virtual reality (VR) platform developed by Google for use with a head mount for a smartphone.<br><br>
                                Named for its fold-out cardboard viewer, the platform is intended as a low-cost system to encourage interest and development in VR applications. Users can either build their own viewer from simple, low-cost components using specifications published by Google, or purchase a pre-manufactured one. The viewer is used by placing a smartphone into the back of it and viewing through the lenses in the front.</p>

                                    <h3>Facebook Oculus Rift</h3>
                                    <p>The Rift has an OLED display, 1080×1200 resolution per eye, a 90 Hz refresh rate, and 110° field of view. It has integrated headphones which provide a 3D audio effect, rotational and positional tracking.<br><br>

                                    The positional tracking system, called "Constellation", is performed by a USB stationary infrared sensor that is picking up light that is emitted by IR LEDs that are integrated into the hmd. The sensor normally sits on the user's desk. This creates 3D space, allowing for the user to use the Rift while sitting, standing, or walking around the same room.</p>

                                <p>When in use, a compatible Samsung Galaxy device acts as the headset's display and processor, while the Gear VR unit itself acts as the controller, which contains the high field of view, as well as a custom inertial measurement unit, or IMU, for rotational tracking, which connects to the smartphone via micro-USB. This IMU is more accurate and well calibrated with lower latency than internal smartphone IMUs, such as those used for Google Cardboard.<br><br>

                                The Gear VR headset also includes a touchpad and back button on the side, as well as a proximity sensor to detect when the headset is on.The touchpad and button allow for a standard minimum input capability for users to interact with the virtual environments, whereas Google Cardboard devices only feature a button.</p>

                                    <p> HTC Vive is a virtual reality headset developed by HTC and Valve Corporation. This headset is designed to utilize "room scale" technology to turn a room into 3D space via sensors, with the virtual world allowing the user to navigate naturally, with the ability to walk around and use motion tracked handheld controllers to vividly manipulate objects, interact with precision, communicate and experience immersive environments.<br><br>

                                    The Vive has a refresh rate of 90 Hz. The device uses two screens, one per eye, each having a resolution of 1080x1200. The device uses more than 70 sensors including a MEMS gyroscope, accelerometer and laser position sensors, and is said to operate in a 15 feet by 15 feet (4.6 meters by 4.6 meters) tracking space if used with both "Lighthouse" base stations that track the user's movement with sub-millimeter precision.</p>

The PlayStation VR system can output a picture to both the PlayStation VR headset and a television simultaneously, with the television either mirroring the picture displayed on the headset, or displaying a separate image for competitive or cooperative gameplay.<br><br>

                                PlayStation VR works with either the standard DualShock 4 controller or the PlayStation Move controllers.The PlayStation VR has a 5.7 inch OLED panel, with an RGB sub-pixel matrix resolution of 1080p, or 960 × 1080 × RGB per eye. The headset also has a processor box which enables the Social Screen video output to the television, as well as process the 3D audio effect, and uses a 3.5mm headphone jack. The headset also has 9 positional LEDs on its surface for the PlayStation Camera to track 360 degree head movement, and connects to the PlayStation by HDMI or USB.</p>
